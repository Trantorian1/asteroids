# Asteroids

This is my submission for the [Asteroids](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python)
project on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) based on [the popular arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) from 1979.

> [!TIP]
> This is a simple implementation, with no added bells or whistles.

## Running

This program requires [python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run as well as
[pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) v3.x.
